- WebRTC support (for WHIP protocol)
- MediaStream API support
- IndexedDB support (for offline storage)

### Streaming Protocols

**RTMP/RTMPS** - Most compatible
- Best for: Twitch, YouTube, Facebook
- Latency: 3-8 seconds
- Browser support: Via preview mode

**SRT** - Low latency

- Latency: <1 second
- Browser support: Via WebTransport proxy

**WebRTC-WHIP** - Ultra-low latency

2. **Preview**: MediaStream displayed in local `<video>` element
3. **Protocol Selection**: Auto-detects protocol from URL
4. **Connection**: Establishes connection to streaming server
5. **Transmission**: Sends encoded media to destination
6. **Monitoring**: Tracks stats, handles reconnections

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### Better Quality
1. Use wired ethernet instead of WiFi
2. Close other browser tabs
3. Reduce video resolution if bandwidth is limited
4. Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings

### Stable Streaming
1. Test your stream key first
2. Keep the browser tab active (not minimized)
3. Use Chrome/Edge for best WebRTC support
4. Check firewall isn't blocking streaming protocols

### Privacy
1. Use RTMPS (secure) instead of RTMP when available
2. Clear browser data after streaming if on shared computer
3. Use browser's incognito mode for temporary streaming

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to access camera/microphone"
**Solution:** Grant permissions when browser asks, or check browser settings

### "Connection failed"
**Solution:** Verify stream URL and key are correct. Check firewall settings.

### "Stream keeps disconnecting"
**Solution:** Check internet connection stability. Try wired ethernet.

### "No video preview"
**Solution:** Ensure camera isn't in use by another app. Try screen share instead.

### "Platform says I'm not live"
**Solution:** Some platforms have delay. Wait 30-60 seconds. Check platform dashboard.
